## TransNet
We introduce the Transport-informed Graph Neural Network (TransNet), a machine learning model that forecasts PM2.5 concentrations for +72-hours by learning coupled Advection-Diffusion-Reaction (ADR) operators, enabling efficient operational deployment.

## Scripts
The following scripts are provided:

- 📝: ``TransNet_train.py``: TransNet model code.
- 📝: ``graph.py``: Graph construction code.
- 📝: ``train_distributed.py``: Distributed training code.

## Getting started :
To ensure the reproducibility of the results, we suggest using the `__.yml` file when creating an environment.
