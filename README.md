## TransNet
We introduce the Transport-informed Graph Neural Network (TransNet), a machine learning model that forecasts PM2.5 concentrations for +72-hours by learning coupled Advection-Diffusion-Reaction (ADR) operators, enabling efficient operational deployment.

# Project structure
This repository is organized as follows:

* :open_file_folder: **figs**: contains model architecture.
* :open_file_folder: **station_info**: Station information.

## Notebooks
The following notebooks are provided:

- :orange_book: ``__.ipynb``: notebook reproducing the evaluation results in the paper.
- :orange_book: ``__preprocessing_notebook__.ipynb``: notebook used to preprocess the data in the paper.

## Scripts
The following scripts are provided:

- üìù: ``__.py``: AGATNet model code.

## Getting started :
To ensure the reproducibility of the results, we suggest using the `__.yml` file when creating an environment.
